In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.
And in Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness does not comprehend it.
