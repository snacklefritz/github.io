		<p class="about-p1-title">Our Story</p>
		<p class="services-p1-text">River of Life Community Church is the result of a merger between two churches: Valley Community Church and Acme Assembly of God. Acme Assembly of God was formed in the mid-1940s. Valley Community Church was formed in teh early 1980's moving into the current building in 1984 as a non-denominational church.</p>
		<p class="services-p1-text">In 1995, with the merger of the two churches, was the new name of River of Life Community Church. We are currently a local, community church associated with the Assembly of God and are considered a cooperative fellowship rather than a denomination. We adhere to a Statement of Fundamental Truths and a Bibical patern of conduct.</p>
